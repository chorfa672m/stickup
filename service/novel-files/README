API description


1) POST /stickup

user=		the app user name
password=	password
latitude=		
longitude=	
message= 	

2) GET /stickups

latitude=
longitude=
count=           (max number of values to return)

This would return the "count" nearest messages. Let's do that in a JSON array. Each element of the array would be a dictionary (object) with these keys:

latitude
longitude
message
date		(keep a datestamp)

3) POST /signup

user=
password=

returning something to indicate success or failure. A JSON structure would be best for this... we could have these keys:

status 		(200 for success, etc.)
message	a message indicating success or failure (if a user name was already taken)
